website 

Its the official website for the technical fest conducted by the Information Technology department of Heritage Institute of Technology. Only the front end development of the website has been taken care of on this project.
Use of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery,Bootstrap.
Being my first project its simple yet elegant. Most importantly the website fully Responsive as well as optimized.
It has been Hosted using Amazon Web Services (aws) and Google Analytics has been added as a cherry over the cake.
